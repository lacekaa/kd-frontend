    <h1>Thank you for participating in our study. Please read the following text carefully.</h1>
    <p>In the following, write a prompt you would use for generating an image with an AI system such as DALL·E. Your
      prompt must be at least one sentence long. When you’re satisfied with it, click the Set Prompt button—after that,
      you won’t be able to edit the text, so make sure it’s final before you click.

      Once the prompt is set, you can mark parts of it as either important or unimportant:

      You must highlight at least one important part of your prompt, but you may highlight multiple ones. You may mark
      as many passages you do not consider important through the "Unimportant" button. When you’ve finished composing
      your prompt and marking important passages and
      unimportant ones, click Submit to complete the experiment.

        Please do not go back to the last page (browser previous page) as your progress will not be saved and you might
        not be able to accomplish the experiment.
        Participation in the study is voluntary. You have the right to withdraw from the study at any time without any
        disadvantages to you.

      An example prompt would be:
      <br>
      <b>
        A calm mountain lake at sunrise
        that reflects the snowy mountains. Warm light shines through the morning mist onto the trees by the shore. A
        single canoe floats gently, making small ripples on the water.
