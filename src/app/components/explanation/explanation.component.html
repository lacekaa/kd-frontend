    <h1>Thank you for participating in our study. Please read the following text carefully.</h1>
    <p>In the following, write a prompt you would use for generating an image with an AI system such as DALL·E. Your
      prompt must be at least one sentence long. When you’re satisfied with it, click the Set Prompt button—after that,
      you won’t be able to edit the text, so make sure it’s final before you click.

      Once the prompt is set, you can mark parts of it as either important or less important:
      <br>
      1. Highlighting important text:
      <br>
      - Select the words or phrases you want to emphasize.
      <br>
      - Click the Highlight button.
      <br>
      - The selected text will appear in red in the lower field.
      <br>
      2. Highlight less important text:
      <br>
      - Select the words or phrases you consider optional.
      <br>
      - Click the Lowlight button.
      <br>
      - These selections will appear in green in the lower field.
      <br>
      You must highlight at least one important part of your prompt, but you may highlight multiple passages and
      lowlight as many optional parts as you like. When you’ve finished composing your prompt and marking highlights and
      lowlights, click Submit to complete the experiment.
      <br>
      An example prompt would be:
      <br>
      <b>
        A calm mountain lake at sunrise
        that reflects the snowy mountains. Warm light shines through the morning mist onto the trees by the shore. A
        single canoe floats gently, making small ripples on the water.
